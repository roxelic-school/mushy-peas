### this says credits but its more of a page for me to rant about this website
Ive written out this page way more than once, im doing this during the setup of the custom linux for it,
it is currently `00:43` and i planned to go to bed at 10pm but for the 3rd day in a row this project has been the only thing
ive done and im deturmined to finish it now.

## some actual credits
- I did *most* of the work but i have had people work with me to test and get their opinions
    - like ieuan who was the main guinea pig for most of this (i used their username like 6 times as test data)

- I took color pallete inspiration from the vencord installer website
- The favicon is copyright of the utc im assuming so

## about this project
### you can skip over this im just talking about my experience making this here
- The backend itself was remade 7 times, which is to be expected because that is the process I have for these sorts of projects, there are probably a few bugs with this one but im not too sure how maintenence will work. I have it setup so when the server is turned on it will automatically update but that depends on how giving this original build to alex plays out.
- The frontend has supprisingly only had 2 itterations, the first one followed a black, red, blue and yellow color scheme, similar to the utc logo itself. I didnt think that one looked very nice at all so i restarted and Im very proud of how this one looks, with it also being very easy to install into the server itself.
- finally the server has to have been the most difficult part, i can tell you that because it isnt even done yet. I have tried so many linux distros but all of them have had some sort of compatibility issue with the software ive been using and how ive had it configured. I think im finally done with this final attempt of `ubuntu` but i hate ubuntu so much which is why ive left it till last to try.

The actual experience for this project i think hasnt been worth it for me, ive missed out on a lot that i wanted to do because i spent so much time worrying about this trying to make sure this was perfect since i thought that it was my first peice of work that would be used by someone and that stopped me from having a lot of fun.
