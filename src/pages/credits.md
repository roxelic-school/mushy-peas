# Hi,

## my experience making this website
I worryed about this way too much for it to have been fun, I spent way too much time focusing on it and almost every waking hour of the 2025 feb holidays on it which feels like a massive waste of my brake.

Thats all though, thank you if you actually ready this. I hope you enjoy the rest of the website!
